    <!-- Abstract section -->
    <h3 id="Abstract">Abstract</h3>
    When we think about surgical robots, we tend to envision shiny, expensive robots that move around in a room automating independently, all powerful and having a level of accuracy that the average human surgeon is incapable of. But developers behind them design them not to replace surgeons entirely, but instead more to reduce human error and enhance surgical precision. This study will thus investigate how feedback systems contribute to these benefits. 
    <h3 id=”Introduction”>Introduction</h3>
       <p class="ex1">
       Surgical robots are becoming increasingly more common in modern hospitals, bringing a level of precision, stability and efficiency that is difficult if not impossible for the human body to perform. In engineering, feedback from these systems is when the robot is allowed to sense, monitor and correct their movements in real time to stay accurate.  

There are 2 main systems which are the most commonly used: first the open loop system which operates without self-correction and the closed loop system, which uses sensor input to adjust its position in real time e.g. by human control, enhances the accuracy of surgical robots through continuous monitoring.  

The open loop system is a system where it is “simply a condition on a functioning machine whereby the system has two basic states: On or Off” ,functioning without sensor input to control its operation, e.g, a light switch remains either “on” or “off” until someone physically changes its position. (Open-Loop Control, Science Direct), 

There is no feedback system to modify the output based on the real life result, running on a line of code with no corrective actions if it goes wrong. For example, a mechanism involving the movement of a robotic arm over to a certain of the body but no way to check if the arm is completely accurate over the exact spot or even slightly off. in the context of surgery, this is can have serious consequences as even a little bit of inaccuracy such as a few millimetres can be the difference between life or death.  

In contrast, a closed loop system continuously uses feedback from sensors to measure its position and make adjustments constantly in real time, providing “enhanced accuracy, precision, and the ability to adapt to varying conditions”, maintaining stable performance even in changing environments found in surgery.  This also increases the system’s robustness to external factors and adapting to them. (SOLO close loop vs open loop control)
