    <h3 id="Abstract">Abstract</h3>
    When we think about surgical robots, we tend to envision shiny, expensive robots that move around in a room automating independently, all powerful and having a level of accuracy that the average human surgeon is incapable of. But developers behind them design them not to replace surgeons entirely, but instead more to reduce human error and enhance surgical precision. Surgical robots are becoming increasingly more common in modern hospitals, bringing a level of precision, stability and efficiency that is difficult if not impossible for the human body to perform.  This article will investigate how 2 feedback systems, the open loop system which operates without self-correction and the closed loop system, which uses sensor input to adjust its position in real time e.g. by human control, enhances the accuracy of surgical robots through continuous monitoring. Findings have shown that the closed loop feedback system have consistently achieved more accurate movements and less positioning errors than the open loop system, showing how feedback mechanisms play a crucial role in reliability, accuracy and control in surgical robots. This study will thus investigate how feedback systems contribute to these benefits.

       <p class="ex1">
        Active Learning (Angluin, 1988, Cohn et al., 1994) is a paradigm where a concept is learnt by an
        intelligent machine through the interaction of an oracle with the machine system, over a sequence of
        learning epochs. A distinctive component in an active system is the querying strategy, used to sample
        candidate training instances from a pool and evaluate them for informativeness, i.e., their potential
        to improve the classification model. Various strategies have been proposed including; Query by
        Committee (Seung et al., 1992), Monte Carlo estimation (Roy and McCallum, 2001), uncertainty
        sampling (Lewis and Gale, 1994) and version space reduction (margin sampling) (Tong and Koller,
        2001). Irrespective of how the most informative pattern instances are chosen at each epoch they are
        presented for labeling, to a machine (database) or human oracle that has knowledge of the class
        labels. After adding the newly labeled instances to the current training set, a revised model is
        subsequently induced. A goal of this process is to achieve an efficient, incremental advancement of
        learning at each epoch. The process is continued until some stopping criterion has been met, such as
        reaching a stage where information from the selected instances is contrary to the model, causing the
        classifier confidence to drop, as in Vlachos (2008).
